## TL;DR

You need to populate a .docx (or .html or .pdf) template hundreds of times. Automate this with R, R Markdown, a style document and `knitr`.

## Purpose

With **beginner R users from my department in mind**, this repository contains files that:

* create an R Markdown template to be filled with data
* use a loop to fill the template with data for each row of your tidy dataset in turn
* render the template to .docx format with reference to a style template

The repository will be referenced in an upcoming post on [rostrum.blog](https://rostrum.blog).

## Disclaimer

There's more than one way to do this. Also I'm not claiming that .docx format is great.
